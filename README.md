# Python for Everybody

I am taking Dr Charles Severance's course via [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) to learn Python 3, my very first programming language.

```python
print('Hallo Python!')
```     

This is the result of a conversation where a friend of mine tried to convince me into believing that the world will soon be divided between coders and non-coders, where programers will possess "magical powers" to access goods and services unavailable to others.

Being a linguaphile, I am excited enough just to add Python to my repertoire (with or without said powers).

Programs written for the course

|Name|Function|
|---|---|
|[00.00_Hello_World](00.00_Hello_World.py)|Print "Hello world!" using Python 3.|

|[03.02_Pay](03.02_Pay.py)|Same as [03.01_Pay](03.01_Pay.py) but exit program if user enters anything other than numbers|
|[04.06_Pay](04.06_Pay.py)|Rewrite [03.01_Pay](03.01_Pay.py) by creating a function called `computepay` which takes two parameters: `hours`, `rate`.|
|[05.01_Calc](05.01_Calc.py)|Have user repeatedly enter numbers until he enters 'done'. When 'done' is entered, print the total, count, and average of the numbers.|
|[05.02_Calc](05.02_Calc.py)|Got told that lists are unnecessary for the objective of [05.01_Calc](05.01_Calc.py).ðŸ¥º Here's an attempt to trim my code down.|
|[06.05_Extract_Convert](06.05_Extract_Convert.py)|In 'X-DSPAM-Conference: 0.8475 ' extract value after ':' and convert it into a floating-point number.|
|[07.01_Shout](07.01_Shout.py)|Write a program to read through [mbox-short.txt](mbox-short.txt) and print its contents (line by line) all in upper case. Prompt the user to enter file name first.|
|[08.05_Email_Client](08.05_Email_Client.py)|Read through [mbox-short.txt](mbox-short.txt) to find lines that start with 'From'. Split each line into words and print the sender's email address. Count and print, at the end, the number of 'From' lines.|
|[09.04_Most_Common_Email](09.00/09.04_Most_Common_Email.py)|Write a program to read through a mail log. Build a histogram using a dictionary to count how many messages have come from each email address. Find the most frequent email address.|
|[09.05_Most_Common_Email](09.00/09.05_Most_Common_Email.py)|Same as [09.04_Most_Common_Email](09.00/09.04_Most_Common_Email.py) but uses regular expression to extract email address.|
|[09.06_Most_Common_Word](09.00/09.06_Most_Common_Word.py)|Count the frequency of each word in a file. Store it in a dictionary. Find the most common word.|
|[10.01_Top5_Emails_wi_Tuples](10.01_Top5_Emails_wi_Tuples.py)|Same as [09.04_Most_Common_Email](09.00/09.04_Most_Common_Email.py) but print the top 5 email addresses with the most commits by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then sort the list in reverse order before printing out the results.|
|[10.11_Top5_Emails_wi_Tuples_and_Generator](10.11_Top5_Emails_wi_Tuples_and_Generator.py)|Same as [10.01_Top5_Emails_wi_Tuples](10.01_Top5_Emails_wi_Tuples.py) but create a generator to enable larger mail-log processing whilst increase efficiency on RAM usage.|
|[12.03_urllib_and_count](12.03_urllib_and_count.py)|Use `urllib` to retrieve a document from a user-input URL, display up to 3000 characters, and count the number of characters in the document (ignore header).|
