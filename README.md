# Python for Everybody

I am taking Dr Charles Severance's course via [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) to learn Python 3, my very first programming language.

```python
print('Hello world!')
```     

This is the result of a conversation where a friend of mine tried to convince me into believing that the world will soon be divided between coders and non-coders, where programers will possess "magical powers" to access goods and services unavailable to others.

As a linguaphile, I am excited to add Python to my repertoire (with or without said powers).
